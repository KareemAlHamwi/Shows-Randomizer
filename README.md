# 🎲 Shows Randomizer

Ever spend 30 minutes deciding what to watch, only to give up and scroll Reels instead? Same. So I made this.

**Shows Randomizer** is a tiny console app that picks a random anime, movie, or series for you.

## ✨ What It Does

- Feeling indecisive? It'll randomly pick something for you.
- Got new shows in mind? Add them in.
- Want to browse what you’ve got? List 'em all.

    All from a chill little terminal window ..

## 🧠 How It Works

- Pure C++ (no fancy libraries).
- Follows the 3-layer architecture — yeah, I know, maybe overkill for something this small but hey, it's clean!
- Reads from simple `.txt` files for your animes, movies, and series.
- Handles user input and navigation with a minimal menu system.

## 🕹 How to Use

1. Run the `Shows Randomizer.exe` file.
2. Add your bucket-list of shows (animes, movies, series, etc .. ).
3. Let it work its magic and choose your next watch.
4. Enjoy the show 🍿
